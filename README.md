# kata

The project was launched in 2012 to simplify the management of kata competitions as a simple alternative to Excel sheets.

In a few months it has been integrated with an Android application, with the aim of eliminating the prints and have a real-time control of the judges' scores.

From 2013 is used in almost all tournaments of the Italian Judo Kata Grand Prix (5-6 dates per year).

## Install
 - Configure LAMP/WAMP instance
 - import kata.sql database
 - edit config.inc.php, set mysql password and $server_url variable with right domain name

## Disclaimer
This software is written in vanilla php, with only PDO and jquery framework.

I'm sincere, many pieces of code I consider them "ugly" myself, when I started coding it was more an exercise than a real project (sorry for italian comments), all was written for the sole purpose of facilitating my work in the management of kata competitions, so the gui is very simple and in pratical use some passages or actions may not seem intuitive.

In the future I would like to rewrite all the software maybe with a better user experience and more frameworks, but right now I have no personal necessity nor have had requests from third parties :)
